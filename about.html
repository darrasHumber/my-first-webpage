    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m <strong>Mohammed Darras</strong>, a mathematician and physicist
      passionate about data and its power to solve real-world problems. With a
      strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, I aim to
      bridge the gap between mathematics, physics, and data science. I enjoy
      exploring new concepts, building models, and contributing to innovative
      projects. Let’s connect and explore the beauty of these fields together!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: When I’m not solving equations, I enjoy hiking, playing chess,
      and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
